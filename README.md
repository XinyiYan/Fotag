Fotag allows users to display a set of images in both List and Grid views, click to view a single image, 
rate images, and filter the list of images by rating.

When first launched, users can click on the "load" icon on the toolbar to select one or more images to load.
    To select multiple files, just press and hold command key, then click items (Mac)

Clicking on an image would enlarge it in a separate window

When exiting the application, all images would be saved, so that on relaunch, the same images are automatically shown

Users can rate each image by selecting the number of stars to assign to that image. 
A filter widget on the toolbar allows the user to filter the display to just show images that have a minimum rating 

Grid and list layouts are supported. Users can toggle between these layouts by clicking buttons on the toolbar

Development Environment:
Mac, Java 10
